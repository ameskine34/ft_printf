# ft_printf
Description
This project is a simplified reimplementation of the standard C library function printf. The goal is to deepen understanding of formatted output in C and to gain experience with variadic functions, which allow functions to accept an indefinite number of arguments.

Once completed and validated, ft_printf will become a fundamental part of future C projects, replacing the standard printf where required.

~ What I Learned :

How variadic functions work in C (using stdarg.h)

Managing buffers and formatted output.

Handling different format specifiers.

Writing modular and reusable C code.

Debugging and testing complex logic.
